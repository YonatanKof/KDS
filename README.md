# KDS

KDS is an enterprise grade, general purpose starter project to design responsive *Webapps.* It's build with *Sketch* and managed in *Kactos,* and it serves as scalable and accessible foundation for large teams or lone designers, to communicate better through design.

> **Enterprise grade?** That means you can build almost every Wabapp you see out there before youâ€™ll need to make your own components, for KDS offer a wide range of them.

> **General purpose?** The design of KSD is generic, atomic, rhizomatic and built to be customize so you'll be able to easily `*` set you own design.
